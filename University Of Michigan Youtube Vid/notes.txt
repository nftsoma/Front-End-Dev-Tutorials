----------USING SEMANTIC TAGS

1. In the beginning( insert dramatic music of your choice...) there was a div
    A. <div> was a way to group related content together
    B. Divs almost always had special classes/ids associated with them  
        a. <div class = "header">   </div>
        b. <div class = "section">   </div>
        c. <div class = "footer">    </div>
            I. by breaking up the divs by header, section and footer, you can go back 
               and modify only that section of the code 


----------<header>

    A. A group of introductory or navigational aids: title, navigation links,etc

<header>
    <h1>This is the Title</h1>
    <h2>The author is Colleen</h2>
</header>

    B. Do not confuse header tag with the head tag. the head tag is only for metadata. 


----------<nav>

    A. this section goes to other links within the site itself
    B. often found in the header tag
        a. should the nav links include lists?


----------<footer>

    A. contains info such as copyright, docs, links to other socials 
    B. typically at the bottom

        -Use symantec tags for easier navigation 


----------Assignment
    A. create a page called index.html
    B. utilize header, main, footer
    C. make sure page validates
